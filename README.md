# Crown² Monorepo (crown2)

This repository contains the Crown² monorepo scaffold for the Core + Startup tier. It includes placeholders and initial configs for:

- `apps/api` - Django/DRF backend
- `apps/web` - React/MUI frontend (Vite)
- `.devcontainer` - VS Code dev container configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` and `Makefile` for local dev

Next steps:
- Scaffold the Django project inside `apps/api` and implement initial apps and models.
- Scaffold the React app inside `apps/web`.
- Add infra templates under `infra/` and CI/CD pipeline secrets.
