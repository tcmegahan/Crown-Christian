Objective

Create a best-in-class Christian school management platform that is secure, reliable, easy to use, and tightly aligned to Christian school values and workflows. Below are15 high-impact improvements I will implement (or start implementing) autonomously.

15 Major Improvements (brief summary + first steps)

1) Microsoft365 & Teams Integration (single sign-on, calendar, files)
 - Add SSO via Azure AD (OIDC) for students/staff/parents; integrate Teams meetings and calendar sync.
 - First step: add Azure AD auth scaffold and configuration placeholders.

2) Role-Based Access + Policy Templates
 - Implement fine-grained roles (admin, principal, teacher, parent, student, board) and policy templates for data access and workflows.
 - First step: add RBAC model and seed role definitions in codebase.

3) Curriculum Mapping & Lesson Planner module
 - Built-in curriculum mapping, standards alignment, and lesson plan templates tied to gradebook.
 - First step: create data models and REST endpoints scaffold for curriculum and lessons.

4) Unified Dashboards for every persona
 - Configurable dashboards for admin, teachers, parents, students, board — widgets, alerts, and quick actions.
 - First step: add dashboard API and React dashboard layout components.

5) Robust SIS Core (attendance, gradebook, schedules)
 - Highly performant attendance recording, standards-based gradebook, and master schedule engine.
 - First step: design normalized data model and APIs for attendance & gradebook.

6) Pastoral Care & Behavior Tracking
 - Discipline, counseling notes, pastoral follow-up workflows with privacy controls and escalation.
 - First step: add models and endpoints for incidents, notes, and follow-ups.

7) Health & Nurse Module
 - Student health records, visit logs, medication schedules and emergency contacts.
 - First step: scaffold health record model and secure endpoints.

8) Parent & Family Portal (multi-account linking)
 - Link multiple students, messaging, billing, volunteer signups, and event sign-ups.
 - First step: design family-account linking data model and UI flows.

9) Secure Integrations & Secrets Management
 - Use Azure Key Vault (or GitHub Secrets) for all secrets; remove any secrets from code/config.
 - First step: add Key Vault integration helper and configuration binding hooks.

10) Accessibility, UX, and Theming
 - WCAG accessibility, responsive UI, and a professional theme optimized for schools.
 - First step: add design tokens, theme, and accessibility audit checklist.

11) Reporting, Compliance & Audit Trails
 - Pre-built reports for accreditation and finance, and immutable audit logs for changes.
 - First step: add audit middleware (who/when/what) and sample report templates.

12) Analytics & Early Warning System
 - Student performance analytics and alerts for at-risk students; configurable thresholds.
 - First step: add event capture and a basic analytics microservice scaffold.

13) Payments & Finance Integration
 - Secure tuition billing, payment gateway integration, and financial reporting.
 - First step: add payment webhook handlers and a secure payments config guide.

14) Modular, Testable Architecture & CI/CD
 - Splited modules, unit/integration tests, and CI pipelines (already added). Use IaC for infra.
 - First step: standardize project layouts and add pipeline templates (Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions).

15) Partnerships & Resources Hub (Christian focus)
 - Integrations with Christian curriculum publishers, choir/music resources, athletic leagues, and service providers.
 - First step: create a Partnerships API and a Resources catalog data model.

Implementation plan (short)
- I will implement these as prioritized tasks across the codebase. For each improvement I will:
1. Add data model scaffolds (Django models + DRF serializers + migrations) for API-backed features.
2. Add backend endpoints (Django REST Framework) and unit tests.
3. Add frontend components (React + TypeScript) with accessibility and theme support.
4. Wire secure secrets via Azure Key Vault and CI secrets.
5. Add CI checks and integration tests.

What I will do next (automatic)
- Create issue/task file entries for each improvement and scaffold the highest-priority ones:
 - Add RBAC model and Azure AD auth scaffold.
 - Add curriculum mapping models and basic endpoints.
 - Add dashboard API scaffold and initial React dashboard component.

If you approve, I will start applying the scaffolds and small, safe commits to the repo (one feature at a time), run tests and build, and report progress. Reply “approve” to start or ask to prioritize a specific item from the list.
